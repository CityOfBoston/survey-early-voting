    <h2>Early Voting</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="component__intro">This fall, the City of Boston will be implementing early voting for the first time. Early voting is similar to absentee voting, however all residents are eligible to participate. From <strong>October 24 through November 7</strong>, you will be able to mail ballots to the Elections Department or vote at any early voting location around the City. Unlike traditional polling, you are not assigned to one location and can visit the location that is most convenient for you.</div>

  <h3>Where and when do I vote?</h3>
  <p>Locations for early voting have not been decided. Unlike traditional voting, you are not assigned to a single polling location and can visit the early voting location that is most convenient for you.</p>
  <p>We're looking for input from residents on where to place early voting sites and what hours would be most convenient for residentsâ€”accessible from your home, on your lunch break, or while running errands.</p>

      <h3>Tell us where you want to vote</h3>
      <p>You can help us determine early voting sites by choosing a location that you would likely use. After selecting a site, you will be asked for days and times that you would prefer. This will not impact your regular polling location.</p>
      <p><em>Thank you for your interest. Voting has closed and we'll release an early voting schedule shortly.</em></p>
