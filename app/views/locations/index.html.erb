    <h2>Early Voting</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="component__intro">Early voting is similar to absentee voting, however all residents are eligible. Throughout the week prior to Election Day, you will be able to mail in ballots to the Elections Department or vote at any of the nine locations around the City. Unlike traditional polling, you are not assigned to one location and can visit the early voting location that is most convenient for you.</div>

<div class="component component--centered component--smallTop">
  <h3>Where do I vote?</h3>
  <p>Locations for early voting have not been decided. We're looking for input from residents on where to place early voting sites so they will be convenient for residentsâ€”accessible from your home, on your lunch break, or while running errands. Choose a site on the map that you would like to see as an early voting location.</p>
